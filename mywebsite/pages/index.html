                        First and foremost, Our goal is to lower the entry barrier of complicated web development and inspire you. In web development, many concepts are intertwined each other. So, it is difficult to decide where to start if you decide to do web development for the first time. I also went through a lot of trial and error when I first started studying. I hope this class can be a milestone for you.

                        Our second goal is to tell you that coding is a tool. It's a very simple fact, but it's also a fact that you often forget when you first learn to code. Most of the time people only focus on learning a programming language. But once you get used to using this tool, you can create anything you want to make. All you need is patience and time.

                        One more thing. have you ever wondered why there are so many programming languages. Can you tell me the programming language you know? C, C++, JAVA, Python, ... There are so many different programming languages in the world. But Why?It is because each language has a purpose intended by the creator of the language. Iâ€™ll give an example from the topic that we are going to learn in Lesson 1. Not technically a programming language though, HTML was created to convey information in a better way. CSS was created to make information more understandable and pretty. Some of you may be taking Python classes here. Python is often used in various fields, but it is particularly useful in data analysis.So, if you get a chance to learn another programming class in the future, think about what you want to do in the future, but not worry about the language you want to learn. And then choose a language that is well used in the field.
